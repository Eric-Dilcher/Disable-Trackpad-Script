This bash script was created to solve the problem that my linux distribution, Ubuntu (and probably most distributions), did not have a tool to disable the trackpad when the trackstick (trackpoint), found on many business laptops such as the ThinkPad series, is in use.

A comment at the top of the shell script details how to use it.

This script has only been tested on a Lenovo Thinkpad T420 running Ubuntu 14.04.
